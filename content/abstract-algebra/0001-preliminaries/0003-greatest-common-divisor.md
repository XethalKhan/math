# Greatest common divisor

## Definition 1

Let $a$ and $b$ be integers. If $b = a k$ for some integer $k$, we write $a | b$.  

An integer $d$ is called a **common divisor** of $a$ and $b$ if $d | a$ and $d | b$.  

**The greatest common divisor** of integers $a$ and $b$ is a positive integer $d$, such that $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$ and if $d'$ is any other common divisor of $a$ and $b$, then $d' | d$. We write $d = gcd(a, b)$.  

We say that two integers $a$ and $b$ are **relatively prime** if $gcd(a, b) = 1$.  

## Definition 2

**The greatest common divisor** of two nonzero integers $a$ and $b$ is the largest of all common divisors of $a$ and $b$.
