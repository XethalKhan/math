# Identity element in a group is unique

The identity element in a group $G$ is unique; that is, there exists only one element $e \in G$ such that $eg = ge = g$ for all $g \in G$.

## Proof

Suppose that $e$ and $e'$ are both identities in $G$. Then $eg = ge = g$ and $e'g = ge' = g$ for all $g \in G$. We need to show that $e = e'$. If we think of $e$ as the identity, then $ee' = e'$; but if $e'$ is the identity, then $ee' = e$. Combining these two equations we have

$$
e = ee' = e'
$$

Because of this theorem, we may unambigously speak of "the identity" of a group and denote it by $e$.
