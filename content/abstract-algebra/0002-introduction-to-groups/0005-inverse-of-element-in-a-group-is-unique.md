# The inverse of an element in a group is unique

If $g$ is any element in a group $G$, then the inverse of $g$, denoted $g^{-1}$ is unique

## Proof

If $g'$ and $g''$ are both inverses of an element $g$ in a group $G$, then $gg' = g'g = e$ and $gg'' = g''g = e$. We want to show that $g' = g''$, but $g' = g'e = g'(gg'') = (g'g)g'' = eg'' = g''$, therefore $g' = g''$.
