# Truth set

For each open sentence $p(x)$, with associated domain of discourse $U$, the subset $P$ of $U$, defined by $P = \\{x \in U | p(x) \text{ is a true statement }\\}$, henceforth described simply by $\\{x | p(x)\\}$ is called the **truth set** of $p(x)$.

We will adopt the notation that truth sets of general predicates $p(x), q(x, y), r(x, y, z)$ are denoted by the corresponding uppercase letters $P, Q, R$ and the like.
