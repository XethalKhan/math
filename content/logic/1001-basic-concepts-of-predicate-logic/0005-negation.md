# Negation

Let $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ be propositional functions over a domain of discourse $U$, with truth sets $P$ and $Q$, respectively. We define the truth set of **negation**

$$
\neg p(x), \text{ not } p(x), \text{ to be } P'
$$

This connection highlights, at the same time, important connections between the algebra of logic and the algebra of sets, and more specifically, correspondences between the logical connective **not**, and the set operation **complement**.

$$
U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}
$$

$$
p(x): x \text{ is odd}
$$

$$
P = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}
$$

$$
\neg p(x) = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}' = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\} = P'
$$
