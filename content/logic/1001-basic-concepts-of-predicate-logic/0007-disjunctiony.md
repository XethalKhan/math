# Disjunction

Let $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ be propositional functions over a domain of discourse $U$, with truth sets $P$ and $Q$, respectively. We define the truth set of **disjunction**:

$$
p(x) \lor q(x), p(x) \text{ or } q(x) \text{ to be } P \cup Q
$$

This connection highlights, at the same time, important connections between the algebra of logic and the algebra of sets, and more specifically, correspondences between the logical connective **or** and the set operation **union**.

$$
U = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\\}
$$

$$
p(x): x \text{ is odd}
$$

$$
q(x): 3 \leq x \lt 8
$$

$$
P = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}
$$

$$
Q = \\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}
$$

$$
P \cup Q = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9\\}
$$

$$
p(x) \lor q(x) = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9\\} = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\} \cup \\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\} = P \cup Q
$$
