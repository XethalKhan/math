# Domain of discourse

Associated with each predicate $p(x)$, there must be a **universal set** $U$ of objects that may be substituted for the variable. The set $U$, often referred to as the **domain of discourse** in the context of the predicate calculus, is sometimes named explicitly and sometimes must be surmised, as was the case with the concept of **universal set** in set theory.

$$
\text{For } p(x) \text{: } x \gt 4 \text{ then } U = \mathbb{R}
$$
