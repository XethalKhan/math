# Predicate

A **predicate** (also named **propositional function** or **open sentence**) is a declarative sentence containing one or more variables, or unknowns. A predicate is not a **statement**, since a predicate is neither true nor false. On the other hand, predicates are closely related to statements, and our notation for them (e.g. $p(x)$ or $q(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are unknowns) reflects that fact.

$$
p(x): x \gt 4 \rightarrow \text{example of predicate in one variable}
$$

$$
p(5): 5 \gt 4 \rightarrow T
$$

$$
p(3): 3 \gt 4 \rightarrow F
$$

----

$$
q(x, y): x = y \rightarrow \text{example of predicate in two variables}
$$

$$
q(3, 6): 3 = 6 \rightarrow F
$$

$$
q(5, 5): 5 = 5 \rightarrow T
$$

In particular, there are two standard procedures by which a predicate can be converted into a statement. These procedures are substitution and quantification. If we wish to convert a predicate into a statement by substitution, we must take care to substitute for each of the unknowns.
