# Logically equivalent predicates

We say that two propositional functions $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ (over a common domain of discourse $U$) are **logically equivalent over $U$** if and only if they have the same **truth sets**, that is $P = Q$.

Two predicates $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ may be equivalent over one domain of discourse and nonequivalent over another.

$$
p(x, y): x = y
$$

$$
q(x, y): x^2 = y^2
$$

$$
\text{ If }
U = \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{R}^+
\text{ then }
p(x, y) = q(x, y)
$$

$$
\text{ If }
U = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}
\text{ then }
p(x, y) \neq q(x, y)
$$

$$
\mathbb{R}^+
\text{ is the set of positive real numbers.}
$$
