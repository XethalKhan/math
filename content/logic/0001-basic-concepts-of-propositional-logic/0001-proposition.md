# Proposition

A **statement**, or **proposition**, is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but is not both true and false. The designation T (true) or F (false), one and only one of which is assignable to any given statement, is called **the truth value** of that statement. In the propositional calculus we use letters in lower case, such as $p, q \text{ and } r$ to represent statements. The propositional calculus is about **compound statements**, joined by one or more **logical connectives**. The truth or falsehood of these compound sentences, depends on the truth or falsehood of their component simple sentences and on characteristics of the connective involved in the compound sentences.
