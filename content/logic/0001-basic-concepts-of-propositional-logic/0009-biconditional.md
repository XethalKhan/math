# Biconditional

The statement **$p$ if and only if $q$**, denoted $p \leftrightarrow q$, also written **$p$ iff $q$**, is true precisely in the cases where $p$ and $q$ are both true or $p$ and $q$ are both false. Such a statement is called a **biconditional**.

| $p$   | $q$   | $p \leftrightarrow q$ |
