# Conjunction

The **conjunction** of $p$ and $q$, denoted $p \land q$ and read **$p$ and $q$** is true precisely when $p$ and $q$ are both true.

| $p$   | $q$   | $p \land q$   |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| T     | T     | T             |
| T     | F     | F             |
| F     | T     | F             |
| F     | F     | F             |
