# Modus ponens

$$
(p \land (p \rightarrow q)) \rightarrow q
$$

We can conclude the truth of a desired proposition $q$ if we can derive $q$ as a logical consequence of some statement $p$, where $p$ in turn is known to be true. Perhaps, we may wish to prove $q$ and find that $q$ can be proved as a consequence of $p$, where $p$ is some well-known theorem. In such a case we say that $q$ is a **corollary** to $p$.

On the other hand, we may wish to prove $q$ where it is evident that $q$ follows from a statement $p$, where the truth of $p$ however is not known. In such a case the burden of proof shifts from proving $q$ directly to trying somehow to prove $p$. A statement $p$ in this context (assuming it can be proved) is often referred to as **lemma**.
