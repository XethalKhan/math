# Tautology

A **statement form** that is true under all possible truth conditions for its components is called a **tautology**.

A **statement form** that is false under all possible truth conditions for its components is called a **contradiction**.

| $p$   | $\neg p$  | $p \land \neg p$  | $p \lor \neg p$   |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| T     | F         | F                 | T                 |
| F     | T         | F                 | T                 |

The theorems of the propositional calculus are the **tautologies**.
