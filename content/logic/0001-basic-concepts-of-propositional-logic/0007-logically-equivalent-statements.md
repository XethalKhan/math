# Logically equivalent statements

Two compound statement forms that have the same truth values as each other under all possible truth conditions for their components are said to be **logically equivalent**.

If we must prove a statement whose form is $p$, and find it easier to prove $q$, where $q$ is logically equivalent to $p$, then we may prove $p$ by proving $q$.

If $p$ and $q$ are compound statement forms, then the statement form $p \leftrightarrow q$ is a tautorogy if and only if $p$ and $q$ have the same truth values under all possible truth conditions; that is, if and only if $p$ and $q$ are **logically equivalent**. This we refer to any **tautology** having the **biconditional** as its main connective as an equivalence.
