# Product rule

The product rule is a rule that applies when there is more than one variable (i.e. thing that can change) involved in determining the final outcome.

## Product rule

Suppose that when you are determining the total number of outcomes, you can identify two different aspects that can vary. If there are $n_1$ possible outcomes for the first aspect, and for each of those possible outcomes, there are $n_2$ possible outcomes for the second aspect, then the total number of possible outcomes will be $n_1 \times n_2$.

## Product Rule for many aspects

Suppose that when you are determining the total number of outcomes, you can identify $k$ different aspects that can vary. If for each $i$ between $1$ and $k$ there are $n_i$ possible outcomes for the $i$-th aspect, then the total number of possible outcomes will be

$$
\displaystyle\prod^{k}_{i = 1} n_i
$$

(that is, the product as $i$ goes from $1$ to $k$ of the $n_i$).

## Example

Kyle wants to buy coffee and a doughnut. The local doughnut shop has five kinds of doughnuts for sale, and sells four varieties of coffee in three sizes. How many different orders could Kyle make?

$$
n_1 \times n_2 \times n_3 = 5 \times 3 \times 4 = 60
$$
