# Sum rule

The sum rule is a rule that can be applied to determine the number of possible outcomes when there are two different things that you might choose to do (and various ways in which you can do each of them), and you cannot do both of them. Often, it is applied when there is a natural way of breaking the outcomes down into cases.

## Sum rule

Suppose that when you are determining the total number of outcomes, you can identify two distinct cases with the property that every possible outcome lies in exactly one of the cases. If there are $n_1$ possible outcomes in the first case, and $n_2$ possible outcomes in the second case, then the total number of possible outcomes will be $n_1 + n_2$.

## Sum Rule for many cases

Suppose that when you are determining the total number of outcomes, you can identify $k$ distinct cases with the property that every possible outcome lies in exactly one of the cases. If for each $i$ between $1$ and $k$ there are $n_i$ possible outcomes in the $i$-th case, then the total number of possible outcomes will be

$$
\displaystyle \sum_{i = 1}^{k} n_i
$$

(that is, the sum as $i$ goes from $1$ to $k$ of the $n_i$).
