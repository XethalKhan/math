# Independent and identically distributed random variables

If $X_1, \dots , X_n$ are **independent** and each has the same marginal distribution with CDF $F$, we say that $X_1, \dots , X_n$ are **iid
(independent and identically distributed)** and we write

$$
X_1, \dots , X_n \sim F
$$

If $F$ has density $f$ we also write $X_1, \dots , X_n \sim f$. We also call $X_1, \dots , X_n$ a **random sample of size $n$ from $F$**
