# Probability equality if CDFs are equal

The following result shows that the cdf completely determines the distribution of a random variable.

## Theorem

Let $X$ have cdf $F$ and let $Y$ have cdf $G$. If $F(x) = G(x)$ for all $x$, then $\mathbb{P}(X \in A) = P(Y \in A)$ for all $A$.

## Proof

Since $F(x) = G(x)$ for every $x$, than we have the same probability in $X$ and $Y$ for every choice of $x$.

Since probabilities are the same, than summing up all values from $A$ will yield the same probability. Hence $\mathbb{P}(X \in A) = P(Y \in A)$.
