# Basis

Suppose $V$ is a **vector space**. Then a subset $S \subseteq V$ is a **basis** of $V$ if it is **linearly independent** and **spans** $V$.

So, a basis is a linearly independent spanning set for a vector space. The requirement that the set spans $V$ insures that $S$ has enough raw material to build $V$, while the linear independence requirement insures that we do not have any more raw material than we need. A basis is a minimal spanning set.

Notice that our definition does not preclude a vector space from having many bases, and this is the case. More generally, we can grab any basis for a vector space, multiply any one basis vector by a nonzero scalar and create a slightly different set that is still a basis.
