# Symmetric matrix

## Informal definition

It will sometimes happen that a matrix is equal to its **transpose**. In this case, we will call a matrix **symmetric**. Informally a matrix is symmetric if we can “flip” it about the main diagonal (upper-left corner, running down to the lower-right corner) and have it look unchanged.

## Formal definition

The matrix $A$ is symmetric if $A = A^t$.

## Example

$$
E =
\begin{bmatrix}
    2 & 3 & -9 & 5 & 7\\
    3 & 1 & 6 & -2 & -3\\
    -9 & 6 & 0 & -1 & 9\\
    5 & -2 & -1 & 4 & -8\\
    7 & -3 & 9 & -8 & -3
\end{bmatrix}
$$
