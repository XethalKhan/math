# Zero vector is unique

Suppose that $V$ is a **vector space**. The zero vector, $0$, is unique.

## Proof

To prove uniqueness, a standard technique is to suppose the existence of two objects. So let $0_1$ and $0_2$ be two zero vectors in $V$. Then

$$
0_1 = 0_1 + 0_2
\\;\\;\\;
\text{ Property 5 of Vector space - Zero vector for } 0_2
$$

$$
= 0_2 + 0_1
\\;\\;\\;
\text{ Property 3 of Vector space - Commutativity }
$$

$$
= 0_2
\\;\\;\\;
\text{ Property 5 of Vector space - Zero vector for } 0_1
$$

This proves the uniqueness since the two zero vectors are really the same.
