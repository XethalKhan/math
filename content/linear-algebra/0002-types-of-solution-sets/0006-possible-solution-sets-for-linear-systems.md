# Possible solution sets for linear systems

A system of linear equations has no solutions, a unique solution or infinitely many solutions.

## Proof

By its definition, a system is either inconsistent or consistent. The first case describes systems with no solutions. For consistent systems, we have the remaining two possibilities as guaranteed by, and described in, [**Theorem Consistent system $r$ and $n$**](./0004-consistent-system-r-and-n.md).
