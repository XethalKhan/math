# Row-equivalent matrices represent equivalent systems

Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are **row-equivalent augmented matrices**. Then the systems of linear equations that they represent are **equivalent systems**.

## Proof

If we perform a single **row operation** on an **augmented matrix**, it will have the same effect as if we did the analogous **equation operation** on the system of equations the matrix represents. By exactly the same methods as we used in the proof of theorem [Gauss's method](./0005-gauss-method.md) we can see that each of these row operations will preserve the set of solutions for the system of equations the matrix represents.
