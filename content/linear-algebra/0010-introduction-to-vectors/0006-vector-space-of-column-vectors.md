# Vector space of column vectors

The vector space $\mathbb{C}^m$ is the set of all column vectors of size $m$ with entries from the set of complex numbers, $\mathbb{C}$.

When a set similar to this is defined using only column vectors where all the entries are from the real numbers, it is written as $\mathbb{R}^m$ and is known as **Euclidean $m$-space.**.

The term **vector** is used in a variety of different ways. We have defined it as an ordered list written vertically. It could simply be an ordered list of numbers, and perhaps written as $⟨2, 3, −1, 6⟩$. Or it could be interpreted as a point in $m$ dimensions, such as $(3, 4, −2)$ representing a point in three dimensions relative to $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes. With an interpretation as a point, we can construct an arrow from the origin to the point which is consistent with the notion that a vector has direction and magnitude.
