# Column vector

## Definition

A **column vector** of size $m$ is an ordered list of $m$ numbers, which is written in order vertically, starting at the top and proceeding to the bottom.

At times we will refer to a column vector as simply a **vector**. Column vectors will be usually written with lower case Latin letter from the end of the alphabet such as $u, v, w, x, y, z$. To refer to the entry or component of vector $v$ in location $i$ of the list, we write $v_i$.

$$
v =
\begin{bmatrix}
    1\\
    2\\
    21
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
v_3 = 21
$$

The **zero vector** of size $m$ is the **column vector** of size $m$ where each entry is the number zero

$$
0 =
\begin{bmatrix}
    0\\
    0\\
    \vdots\\
    0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

or defined much more compactly $0_i = 0$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$
