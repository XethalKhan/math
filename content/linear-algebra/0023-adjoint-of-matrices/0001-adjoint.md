# Adjoint

If $A$ is a matrix, then its adjoint is $A^{*} = (\overline{A})^{t}$.

You will see the adjoint written elsewhere variously as $A^H, A^{*} \text{ or } A^{\cross}$. Notice that **Theorem Matrix Conjugate and Transpose** says it does not really matter if we conjugate and then transpose, or transpose and then conjugate.
