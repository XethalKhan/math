# Nonsingular Matrices have Linearly Independent Columns

Suppose that $A$ is a **square matrix**. Then $A$ is **nonsingular** if and only if the columns of $A$ form a **linearly independent set**.

## Proof

This is a proof where we can chain together equivalences, rather than proving the two halves separately.

$$
A \text{ nonsingular } \leftrightarrow LS(A, 0) \text{ has a unique solution (Definition of Nonsingular Matrix)}
$$

$$
\leftrightarrow \text{ columns of } A \text{ are linearly independent (By theorem Linearly Independent Vectors and Homogeneous Systems)}
$$
