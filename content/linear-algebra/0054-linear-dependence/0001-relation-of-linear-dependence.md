# Relation of Linear Dependence

Suppose that $V$ is a **vector space**. Given a set of vectors $S = \\{ u_1, u_2, u_3, \dots , u_n \\}$, an equation of the form

$$
\alpha_1 u_1 + \alpha_2 u_2 + \alpha_3 u_3 + \dots + \alpha_n u_n = 0
$$

is a **relation of linear dependence** on $S$. If this equation is formed in a trivial fashion, i.e. $\alpha_i = 0, 1 \leq i \leq n$, then we say it is a **trivial relation of linear dependence** on $S$.
