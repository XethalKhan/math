# Relation of Linear Dependence for Column Vectors

Given a set of vectors $S = { u_1, u_2, u_3, \dots , u_n }$, a true statement of the form

$$
\alpha_1 u_1 + \alpha_2 u_2 + \alpha_3 u_3 + \dots + \alpha_n u_n = 0
$$

is a relation of linear dependence on $S$. If this statement is formed in a trivial fashion, i.e. $\alpha_i = 0, 1 \leq i \leq n$, then we say it is the **trivial relation of linear dependence** on $S$.
