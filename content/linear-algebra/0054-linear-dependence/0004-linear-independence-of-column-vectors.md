# Linear Independence of Column Vectors

The set of vectors $S = { u_1, u_2, u_3, \dots , u_n }$ is **linearly dependent** if there is a relation of linear dependence on $S$ that is not trivial. In the case where the only relation of linear dependence on $S$ is the trivial one, then $S$ is a **linearly independent** set of vectors.
