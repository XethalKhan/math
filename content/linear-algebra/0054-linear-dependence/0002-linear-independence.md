# Linear independence

Suppose that $V$ is a **vector space**. The set of vectors $S = \\{ u_1, u_2, u_3, \dots , u_n \\}$ from $V$ is **linearly dependent** if there is a relation of linear dependence on $S$ that is not trivial. In the case where the **only** relation of linear dependence on $S$ is the trivial one, then $S$ is a **linearly independent** set of vectors.
