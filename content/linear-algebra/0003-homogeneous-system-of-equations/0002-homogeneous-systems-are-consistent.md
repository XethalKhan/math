# Homogeneous systems are consistent

Suppose that a system of linear equations is homogeneous. Then the system is consistent and one solution is found by setting each variable to zero.

## Proof

Set each variable of the system to zero. When substituting these values into each equation, the left-hand side evaluates to zero, no matter what the coefficients are. Since a homogeneous system has zero on the right-hand side of each equation as the constant term, each equation is true. With one demonstrated solution, we can call the system consistent.

Since this solution is so obvious, we will define it as the **trivial solution**.
