# Homogeneous system with more variables than equations has infinite solutions

Suppose that a homogeneous system of linear equations has $m$ equations and $n$ variables with $n \gt m$. Then the system has infinitely many solutions.

## Proof

We are assuming the system is homogeneous, so theorem [**Homogeneous Systems are Consistent**](./0002-homogeneous-systems-are-consistent.md) says it is consistent. Then the hypothesis that $n \gt m$, together with theorem [**Consistent system with more variables than equations has infinite solutions**](./../0002-types-of-solution-sets/0007-consistent-system-with-more-variables-than-equations-has-infinite-solutions.md), gives infinitely many solutions.
