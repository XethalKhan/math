# Homogeneous System

A system of linear equations, $LS(A, b)$ is **homogeneous** if the vector of constants is the **zero vector**, in other words, if $b = 0$.

## Example

$$
\displaylines{
2 x_1 - 3 x_2 + x_3 - 6 x_4 = 0\\
4 x_1 + x_2 + 2 x_3 + 9 x_4 = 0\\
3 x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + 8 x_4 = 0
}
$$

Setting each variable to zero will always be a solution of a **homogeneous system**.
