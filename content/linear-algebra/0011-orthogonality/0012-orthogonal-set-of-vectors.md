# Orthogonal set of vectors

Suppose that $S = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3, \dots , u_n\\}$ is a set of vectors from $\mathbb{C}^{m}$. Then $S$ is an **orthogonal set** if every pair of different vectors from $S$ is orthogonal, that is $⟨u_i, u_j⟩ = 0$ whenever $i \neq j$.

In this definition, we extended the definition of [**Orthogonal Vector**](./0011-orthogonal-vectors.md) to whole sets by requiring vectors to be pairwise orthogonal.
