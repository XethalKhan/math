# Linear algebra

## TODO:

1. Ordering should go from specific to general/abstract. Create the following
    1. System of linear equations
    2. Matric - specific
    3. Vector operations - vector specific
    4. Vector spaces ("Introduction to vectors") - general

## 1. Systems of Linear Equations, their matrix representation and solving
