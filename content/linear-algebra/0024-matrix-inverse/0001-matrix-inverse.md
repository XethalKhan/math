# Matrix inverse

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are **square matrices** of size $n$ such that $AB = I_n$ and $BA = I_n$. Then $A$ is **invertible** and $B$ is the **inverse** of $A$. In this situation, we write $B = A^{- 1}$.

Notice that if $B$ is the inverse of $A$, then we can just as easily say $A$ is the inverse of $B$, or $A$ and $B$ are inverses of each other.

Not every square matrix has an inverse.
