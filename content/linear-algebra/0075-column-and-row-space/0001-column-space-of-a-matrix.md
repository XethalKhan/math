# Column space of a Matrix

Suppose that $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix with columns $A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots , A_n$. Then the **column space** of $A$, written $\mathcal{C}(A)$, is the subset of $\mathbb{C}^m$ containing all linear combinations of the columns of $A$,

$$
\mathcal{C}(A) = ⟨{A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots , A_n }⟩
$$

## Note

So if we fix the **coefficient matrix**, and vary the vector of constants, we can sometimes find consistent systems, and sometimes inconsistent systems. The vectors of constants that lead to consistent systems are exactly the elements of the column space.
