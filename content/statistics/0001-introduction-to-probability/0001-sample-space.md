# Sample space

## Definition

The **sample space** $\Omega$ is the set of possible outcomes of an experiment. Points $\omega$ in $\Omega$ are called **sample outcomes, realizations, or elements**. Subsets of $\Omega$ are called **events**.

## Example

If we toss a coin twice then $\Omega = \\{HH, HT, TH, TT\\}$. The event that the first toss is heads is $A = \\{HH, HT\\}$.

## Summary of terminology using set theory

| Symbol                | Meaning                                           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| $\Omega$              | Sample space                                      |
| $\omega$              | outcome (point or element)                        |
| $A$                   | event (subset of $\Omega$)                        |
| $A'$                  | complement of $A$ (not $A$)                       |
| $A \cup B$            | union ($A$ or $B$)                                |
| $A \cap B$ or $AB$    | intersection ($A$ and $B$)                        |
| $A âˆ’ B$               | set difference ($\omega$ in $A$ but not in $B$)   |
| $A \subset B$         | set inclusion                                     |
| $\emptyset$           | null event (always false)                         |
| $\Omega$              | true event (always true)                          |
