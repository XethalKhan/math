# Uniform probability distribution

If $\Omega$ is finite and if each outcome is equally likely, then

$$
\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}
$$

which is called the **uniform probability distribution**.

To compute probabilities, we need to count the number of points in an event $A$. Methods for counting points are called **combinatorial methods**.

## Example

Suppose that the sample space $\Omega = \\{\omega_1, \dots , \omega_n\\}$ is finite. For example, if we toss a die twice, then $\Omega$ has $36$ elements

$$
\Omega = \\{(i, j); i, j \in \\{1,... 6\\} \\}.
$$

If each outcome is equally likely, then $\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{|A|}{36}$ where $|A|$ denotes the number of elements in $A$. The probability that the sum of the dice is $11$ is $\frac{2}{36}$ since there are two outcomes that correspond to this event.
