# Image

Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a **mapping**, and let $M \subseteq A$ and $N \subseteq B$. Then we define

1. The **image $f(M)$ of $M$ under $f$** by $f(M) = \\{ f(m) | m \in M \\}$
2. The **inverse image $f^{- 1}(N)$ of $N$ under $f$** by $f^{- 1}(N) = \\{ x \in A | f(x) \in N \\}$

## Note

Let us begin with some basic facts. Note first that $f(M)$ and $f^{- 1}(N)$ are sets; $f(M)$ is a subset of $B$, whereas $f^{- 1}(N)$ is a subset of $A$. Note also that $f^{- 1}(N)$ is a separate entity from the inverse relation $f^{- 1}$ and, in particular, is always defined, even when the relation $f^{- 1}$ is not a **function**.
