# Inverse of a function

The **inverse of a function** $f$ is simply the inverse $f^{-1} = \\{ (y, x) | y = f(x) \\}$ of $f$ regarded as a relation (see definition **relation inverse**).

The properties $dom(f^{-1}) = rng(f), rng(f^{-1}) = dom(f) \text{ and } (f^{-1})^{-1} = f$ listed in theorem **basic properties of relation inverse** are true in the special case of relation that happens to be a function.

The key question concerning inverse function is: "Under what circumstance(s) is the inverse of a function itself a function?". In order for $f^{-1}$ to be a function, it must be the case that no two distinct ordered pairs of elements $f^{-1}$ have the same first element. This means that, back in $f$, it must have happened that no two distinct ordered pairs had the same second element (based on a definition for a [**function**](./0001-function.md)).

## Example 1

If

$$
f = \\{ (3, 5), (5, 8), (7, 11), (9, 14), (11, 17) \\}
$$

then

$$
f^{-1} = \\{ (5, 3), (8, 5), (11, 7), (14, 9), (17, 11) \\}
$$

## Example 2

If 

$$
g = \\{( x , 4 x - 7 ) | x \in \mathbb{R} \\}
$$

then

$$
g^{-1} = \\{(4 x - 7, x) | x \in \mathbb{R} \\}
$$
