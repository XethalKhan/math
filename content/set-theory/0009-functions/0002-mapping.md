# Mapping

A **function** from a set $A$ to a set $B$, denoted $f: A \rightarrow B$ (also known as **mapping from $A$ to $B$**, or simply a **mapping**) consists of a function $f$, satisfying $dom(f) = A$, and a set $B$ such that $rng(f) \subseteq B$. The set $B$ is called the **codomain** of $f$.

The notation $f: A \rightarrow B$ from definition is usually read "$f$ is a mapping from the set $A$ to the set $B$" or "$f$ is a function that maps the set $A$ to the set $B$". The concept of "function from $A$ to $B$" or "mapping (from $A$ to $B$)" differs in a subtle way from that of **function**, a mapping consists of a function plus something more. In order to define a mapping, we must specify along with the function $f$ (whose definition already determines the sets $dom(f)$ and $rng(f)$) a set $B$ such that $rng(f) \subseteq B$.

It is possible to have two distinct mappings, both of which involve the same function. The mappings $k: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $k: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, \infty)$, where $k(x) = x^4$, illustrate this situation. We say that mappings $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: C \rightarrow D$ are equal if and only if $f = g$ (which implies automatically that $A = C$) and $B = D$.
