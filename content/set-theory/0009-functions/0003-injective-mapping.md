# Injective mapping

A mapping $f: A \rightarrow B$ is said to be **one-to-one**, or **injective** if and only if the function $f$ is a one-to-one function; that is, whenever $x_1, x_2 \in A$ with $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $x_1 = x_2$. Such a mapping is also said to be an **injection** of $A$ into $B$.

The mapping $k: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $k(x) = x^4$ is not injective since $16 = k(2) = k(-2)$, but any linear mapping $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, f(x) = a x + b$ is an **injection** provided $a \neq 0$. The one-to-one property of a mapping depends entirely on the "ordered pair part" of the mapping, that is, it is not affected by the choice of **codomain**.
