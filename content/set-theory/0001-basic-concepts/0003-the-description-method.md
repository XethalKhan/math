# The description method

## Definition

Method of describing sets. We describe a set in terms of one or more properties to be satisfied by objects in the set, and by those objects only.

$$
A = \\{x | \text{x satisfies some property or properties}\\}
$$

$$
C = \\{x | x \in \mathbb{N} \land x \lt 100\\}
$$

$$
D = \\{x | \text{x is the name of a state in USA beginning with M}\\}
$$

The set is understood to consist of all objects satisfying the preceding description, and only those objects.

$$
57 \in C \\;\\;\\;\\; 126 \notin C \\;\\;\\;\\; \text{Maine} \in D
$$

It is in connection with the description method that well-definedness comes into play. The rule or rules used in describing a set must be:

1. meaningfull, that is, use words and/or symbols with an understood meaning
2. specific and definitive, as opposed to vague and indefinite

$$
F = \\{x | x \in \mathbb{N} \land x \lt 10^8\\} \\;\\;\\;\\;\\; I = \\{x | x \in \mathbb{R} \land 0 \leq x \leq 1\\}
$$
