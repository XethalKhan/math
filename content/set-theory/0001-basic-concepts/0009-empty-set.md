# Empty set

## Informal definition using interval

If $a = b$ in **interval** $I = \\{x \in \mathbb{R} | a \lt x \lt b\\}$ no real number satisfies the criterion for membership in the open interval $(a, a)$, since no real number is simultaneously greater than and less than $a$. If this special case is to be regarded as set, much less an interval, we must posit the existance of a set with no elements. This we do under a title of **empty set** or **null set**, denoted either $\emptyset$ or $\\{\\}$. **Empty set** is at the opposite end of the spectrum from a **universal set**. Another justification for the existance of an empty set, is the desirability that the intersection of any two sets be a set.
