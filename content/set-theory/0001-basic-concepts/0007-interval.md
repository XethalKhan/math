# Interval

## Definition

A set $I$, all of whose elements are real numbers, is called an **interval** if and only if, whenever $a$ and $b$ are elements of $I$ and $c$ is a real number with $a \lt c \lt b$, then $c \in I$.

Intervals are characterized among other sets of real numbers by the property of containing any number between two of its members. All intervals must do this and intervals are the only sets of real numbers that do this.

Nine types of intervals are described by the following terminology and notation, in which $a$ and $b$ denote real numbers:

$$
\\{x \in \mathbb{R} | a \leq x \leq b\\}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{closed and bounded interval, denoted}
\\;\\;\\;
[a, b]
$$

$$
\\{x \in \mathbb{R} | a \lt x \lt b\\}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{an open and bounded interval, denoted}
\\;\\;\\;
(a, b)
$$

$$
\\{x \in \mathbb{R} | a \leq x \lt b\\}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{an closed-open and bounded interval, denoted}
\\;\\;\\;
[a, b)
$$

$$
\\{x \in \mathbb{R} | a \lt x \leq b\\}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{an open-closed and bounded interval, denoted}
\\;\\;\\;
(a, b]
$$

$$
\\{x \in \mathbb{R} | a \leq x\\}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{a closed and unbounded above interval, denoted}
\\;\\;\\;
[a, \infty)
$$

$$
\\{x \in \mathbb{R} | a \lt x\\}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{an open and unbounded above interval, denoted}
\\;\\;\\;
(a, \infty)
$$

$$
\\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x \leq b\\}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{a closed and unbounded below interval, denoted}
\\;\\;\\;
(- \infty, b]
$$

$$
\\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x \lt b\\}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{an open and unbounded below interval, denoted}
\\;\\;\\;
(- \infty, b)
$$

$$
\mathbb{R}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{itself is an interval and is sometimes denoted}
\\;\\;\\;
(- \infty, \infty)
$$
