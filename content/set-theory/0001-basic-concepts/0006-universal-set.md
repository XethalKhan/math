# Universal set

## Informal definition

A **universal set** is the set of all objects under discussion in a particular setting. Idea of a universal set in an absolute sense, that is,  a set containing all objects, leads to serious logical difficulties and so is not used in set theory, but the concept, when applied in a more limited sense, has considerable value. A **universal set** $U$ will often be specified at the start of a problem involving sets, whereas in other situations a universal set is more or less clearly, but implicitly, understood as background to a problem. The role then of a **universal set** is to put some bounds on the nature of the objects that can be considered for membership in the sets involved in a given situation.

There are certain sets of numbers that serve as a unversal set so frequently that we assign them (widely used and recognized) names and symbols:

$$
\mathbb{N}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{the set of all positive integers (natural numbers)}
\\;\\;\\;
\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}
$$

$$
\mathbb{Z}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{the set of all integers (signed whole numbers)}
\\;\\;\\;
\mathbb{Z} = \\{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3\\}
$$

$$
\mathbb{Q}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{the set of all rational numbers (quotitients of integers)}
\\;\\;\\;
\mathbb{Q} = \\{\frac{p}{q} | p \in \mathbb{Z}, q \in \mathbb{N}\\}
$$

$$
\mathbb{R}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{the set of all real numbers (the reals)}
$$

$$
\mathbb{C}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{the set of all complex numbers}
$$

It is of vital importance, also, to realize that the universal set specified in the description of a set is as important as the rest of the definition.

$$
F = \\{x | x \in \mathbb{N} \land x \lt 10^8\\}
$$

$$
I = \\{x | x \in \mathbb{R} \land 0 \leq x \leq 1\\}
$$
