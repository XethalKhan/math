# Proper subset

## Informal definition

When we are told that $A \subseteq B$, the possibility that $A$ and $B$ are equal is left open. To exclude that possibility, we use the notation and terminology of **proper subset**.

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We say that $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, denoted $A \subset B$, if and only if $A \subseteq B \text{ but } A \neq B$. We write $A \not\subset B$ to symbolize the statement that $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$ (which could mean that either $A \nsubseteq B$ or $A = B$).
