# Domain and range of relation

Let $R$ be a **relation** from a set $A$ to a set $B$. We define the **domain of $R$** to be the set $dom(R) = \\{ x \in A | x R y \text{ for some } y \in B \\}$ and the **range of $R$** by the rule $rng(R) = \\{ y \in B | x R y \text{ for some } x \in A \\}$.

Clearly whenever $R$ is a relation from $A$ to $B$, $dom(R)$ is a subset of $A$ and $rng(R)$ is a subset of $B$. In fact, $dom(R)$ consists of those elements of $A$ that are first elements of ordered pairs in $R$, whereas $rng(R)$ comprises the elements of $B$ that are second elements of ordered pairs in $R$.

$$
A = \\{ 1, 2, 3 \\}
$$

$$
B = \\{ w, x, y, z \\}
$$

$$
R = \\{ (2, x), (2, y), (2, z) \\}
$$

$$
dom(R) = \\{ 2 \\}
$$

$$
rng(R) = \\{ x, y, z \\}
$$
