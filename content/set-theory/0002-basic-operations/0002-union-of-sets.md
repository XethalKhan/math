# Union of sets

## Informal definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We define **the union of A and B**, denoted $A \cup B$ (read **A union B**) by $A \cup B = \\{x | x \in A \lor x \in B\\}$.

$A \cup B$ is a set and is formed from $A$ and $B$. It's elements are any object in either $A$ or $B$, including any object that happens to lie in both $A$ and $B$.

$$
A = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}
\\;\\;\\;
B = \\{1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16\\}
\\;\\;\\;
A \cap B = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 16\\}
$$
