# Cartesian product

## Definition

Given sets $A$ and $B$, we define **cartesian product $A \times B$** (read **A cross B**, cartesian product is often called **cross product**) by the rule $A \times B = \\{(a, b) | a \in A \land b \in B \\}$

If $U$ were the **universal set** for sets $A$ and $B$, it would again be the universal set for $A \cap B, A \cup B, A', A - B \text{ and } A \triangle B$. Putting it differently, the elements of these sets are the same types of objects as those that constitute $A$ and $B$ themselves. This is not the case for $A \times B$, **the cartesian product of $A$ and $B$**. The elements of $A \times B$ are ordered pairs of elements from $A$ and $B$, and thus are not ordinarily members of the **universal set** for $A$ and $B$.

An object $x$ is an element of $A \times B$ if and only if there exist $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ such that $x = (a, b)$. Note that there is nothing in the definition to prevent $A$ and $B$ from being the same set.
