# Ordered pair

## Informal definition

**Ordered pairs** resemble notationally two-element sets but differ in two important respects. Represented by the symbol $(a, b)$, **the ordered pair $a$ comma $b$** differs from set $\\{a, b\\}$ in that the order in which the elements are listed makes a difference. Specifically, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ and $(b, a)$ are different, or unequal unless $a = b$.

Given ordered pairs $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ we say that these ordered pairs are equal, denoted $(a, b) = (c, d)$, if and only if $a = c$ and $b = d$.

$$
(2, 3) \neq (3, 2)
\text{ while }
\\{2, 3\\} = \\{3, 2\\}
$$

$(a, a)$ is valid expression, but $\\{a, a\\}$ is not ($\\{a\\}$ is correct).
