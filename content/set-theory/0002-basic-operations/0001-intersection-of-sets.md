# Intersection of sets

Let $A$ and $B$ be **sets**. We define a set formed from $A$ and $B$, called **the intersection of $A$ and $B$**, denoted $A \cap B$ (read **A intersection B**) by the rule $A \cap B = \\{x | x \in A \land x \in B\\}$.

Note that $A \cap B$ is a **set** whose elements are the objects common to $A$ and $B$.

$$
A = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}
\\;\\;\\;
B = \\{1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16\\}
\\;\\;\\;
A \cap B = \\{1, 7\\}
$$

This operation is **binary operation**, it is applied to **two** sets to create third set.
