# Set theoretic difference

## Informal definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We define the difference $B - A$ (read **B minus A**) by the rule $B - A = \\{x | x \in B \land x \notin A\\}$. **Set theoretic difference**, sometimes denoted $A \backslash B$, is a binary operation that yields complement of $A$ relative to a set $B$. Sometimes, this operation is called **relative complement**.

$$
\\{1, 2, 3\\} \backslash \\{2, 3, 4\\} = \\{1\\}
\\;\\;\\;
\\{2, 3, 4\\} \backslash \\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{4\\}
$$

The difference $B - A$, (also called **the complement of A in B** or **the complement of A relative to B**) consists of all objects that are elements of $B$ and are not elements of $A$. If $B = U$, then $B - A = U - A = A'$, the ordinary **complement** of $A$. This **complement** is a special case of **difference**. We do not need to know $U$ in order to compute $B - A$.
