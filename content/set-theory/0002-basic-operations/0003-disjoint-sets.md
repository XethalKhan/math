# Disjoint sets

## Informal definition

Pairs of sets, having no elements in common, are said to be **disjoint**.

$$
A = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}
\\;\\;\\;
D = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\}
\\;\\;\\;
A \cap D = \emptyset
$$

The intersection of $A$ and $D$ provides another justification for the existance of an **empty set** since $A$ and $D$ have no elements in common.
