# Symmetric difference

## Informal definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We define the **symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$**, denoted $A \ominus B$ (sometimes $A \triangle B$), by the rule $A \triangle B = (A - B) \cup (B - A)$.

To be in $A \triangle B$, an object must lie either in $A - B$ or $B - A$, either in $A$ but not in $B$, or in $B$ but not in $A$. Elements of $A \triangle B$ are objects in one or the other of the sets $A$ and $B$, but not in both.
