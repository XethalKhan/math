# $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{R}$

$\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{R}$

Since $R \cong (0, 1)$, we may conclude from this theorem that $N \preceq (0, 1)$ also. Viewing the relation $\preceq$ between sets as a
relation between the cardinal numbers of those sets, we may rephrase this theorem as $\aleph_0 \preceq c$.

## Proof

We prove this by [**Lemma - set subset and less than relation**](./0009-set-subset-and-less-than-relation.md)

Since $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ than $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{R}$

## Note

Actually, there is much more we can say about the relationship between $\aleph_0$ and $c$.

### First, we may conclude $ \aleph_O \prec c$

We showed that $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{R}$

By theorem [**Open interval is not equivalent to $\mathbb{N}$**](./0005-open-interval-is-not-equivalent-to-n.md) we saw that $\mathbb{N} \not \cong (0, 1)$. Since $(0, 1) \cong \mathbb{R}$, than $\mathbb{N} \prec \mathbb{R}$ which is equal to statement $ \aleph_O \prec c$.

### Second,

and quite remarkably, we can prove that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) \cong R$, a result often expressed in terms of cardinal numbers by the equation $2^{\aleph_0} = c$. (Note: If $A$ and $B$ are sets with cardinal numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we denote by $\alpha^{\beta}$ the cardinal number of the set of all mappings from $B$ into $A$. Hence $2^{\aleph_0}$ is the cardinal number of the set of all mappings of $\mathbb{N}$ into $\\{0, 1 \\}$, clearly numerically equivalent to the collection of all subsets of $\mathbb{N}$.)
