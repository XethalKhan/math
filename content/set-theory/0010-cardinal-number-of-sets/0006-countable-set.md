# Countable set

A set that is numerically equ$ivalent to $\mathbb{N}$ is said to be **countably infinite** or **denumerable**. Any set that is either finite or countably infinite is said to be **countable**. An infinite set that is not countable is said to be **uncountable**.

The sets ${ 1, 2, 3, \dots , 100}, \mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}^{+}, \text{ and } \mathbb{Q}$ are all countable sets; the latter four are countably infinite. The sets $\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{C}$, and $(0, 1)$, and indeed any interval on the real line are uncountable, and in fact have the cardinal number $c$.
