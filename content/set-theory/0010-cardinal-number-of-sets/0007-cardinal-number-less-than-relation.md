# Countable number less than relation

Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. We write $A \preceq B$ and say the **cardinal number of $A$ is less than or equal to the cardinal number of $B$**, if and only if there exists a one-to-one mapping $f: A \rightarrow B$.

We write $A \prec B$ if and only if $A \preceq B$, but $A \not \cong B$. In this case we say that the **cardinal number of $A$ is (strictly) less than the cardinal number of $B$**.

Note that $A \preceq B$ if and only if $A$ is numerically equivalent to a subset of $B$ (namely, image of $f, im(f)$), including possibly $B$ itself. Stated differently, the relationship $A \preceq B$ between two sets leaves open the possibility that $A \cong B$, analogous to the connection between the relations $\leq$ and $=$ on the real numbers. On the other hand, $A \prec B$ means that there exists a one-to-one
mapping of $A$ **into** $B$, but no such mapping of $A$ **onto** $B$.
