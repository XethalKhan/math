# Equivalence classes are partitions

Let $E$ be an **equivalence relation** on a set $A$. Then the **collection of sets** $A/E = \\{ [x] | x \in A \\}$ of **equivalence classes** generated by $E$ is a **partition** of $A$.

This theorem is a corollary of theorem [**Properties of equivalence classes**](./0005-properties-of-equivalence-classes.md)
