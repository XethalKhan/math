# Inverse process of equivalence relations and partitions

1. Let $E$ be an **equivalence relation** on a set $A$, Then $A/(A/E) = E$
2. Let $\mathfrak{B}$ be a partition of a set $A$. Then $A/(A/\mathfrak{B}) = \mathfrak{B}$

## Proof

### 1. Let $E$ be an **equivalence relation** on a set $A$, Then $A/(A/E) = E$

We must show that $A/(A/E) \subseteq E$ and $E \subseteq A/(A/E)$. Since $E$ is an **equivalence relation** on $A$, then $A/E$ is a **partition** of $A$ and so $A/(A/E)$ is an **equivalence relation** on $A$.

Let $(x, y) \in A/(A/E)$. Then there exists a **cell** $X$ of a **partition** $A/E$ such that $x \in X$ and $y \in X$. But the **cells** of $A/E$ are precisely the **equivalence classes** generated by $E$. Since $X$ is therefore an **equivalence class** generated by $E$ and since $X$ contains both $x$ and $y$, it follows that $[x] = X = [y]$ so that $x E y$ or $(x, y) \in E$, as desired. Thus $A/(A/E) \subseteq E$.

Conversly, suppose $(x, y) \in E$. To show that $(x, y) \in A/(A/E)$, we must prove that there exists a **cell** $X$ of the partition $A/E$ that contains both $x$ and $y$. Since $x E y$, then $[x] = [y]$. Letting $X = [x] = [y]$, we note that $X$ is a **cell** of $A/E$ and contains both $x$ and $y$, as desired. Hence $(x, y) \in A/(A/E)$ and $E \subseteq A/(A/E)$, as we wished to prove.

### 2. Let $\mathfrak{B}$ be a partition of a set $A$. Then $A/(A/\mathfrak{B}) = \mathfrak{B}$

We must show that $A/(A/\mathfrak{B}) \subseteq \mathfrak{B}$ and $\mathfrak{B} \subseteq A/(A/\mathfrak{B})$. Since $\mathfrak{B}$ is a **partition** on $A$, then $A/\mathfrak{B}$ is an **equivalence relation** of $A$ and so $A/(A/\mathfrak{B})$ is a **partition** on $A$.

Let $X \in A/(A/\mathfrak{B})$, and $X \neq \emptyset$ and $x \in X$. Then there exist an **equivalence class** $[x] = X$ of a **equivalence relation** $A/\mathfrak{B} = E$ such that $x E x$. But the **equivalence classes** of $A/\mathfrak{B}$ are precisely the **cells** generated by $\mathfrak{B}$, $X \in \mathfrak{B}$ as desired. Thus $A/(A/\mathfrak{B}) \subseteq \mathfrak{B}$.

Conversly, suppose $X \neq \emptyset$ and $x \in X$ and $X \in \mathfrak{B}$. To show $X \in A/(A/\mathfrak{B})$, we must prove that there exists an **equivalence class** $[x]$ of the **equivalence relation** $A/\mathfrak{B} = E$. Since $x \in X$ and $X \in \mathfrak{B}$, then $x E x$. Since $X = [x]$, we note that $X$ is an **equivalence class** of $A/\mathfrak{B}$. Hence $X \in A/(A/\mathfrak{B})$ and $\mathfrak{B} \in A/(A/\mathfrak{B})$, as we desired.

## Example

$$
A = \\{ 1, 2, 3 \\}
$$

$$
E = \\{ (1, 1), (2, 2) , (3, 3), (2, 3), (3, 2) \\}
$$

$$
\mathfrak{B} = \\{ \\{1 \\}, \\{2, 3 \\} \\}
$$

$$
A / E = \\{ \\{1 \\}, \\{2, 3 \\} \\} \text{ see Equivalence classes are partitions }
$$

$$
A / ( A / E ) = \\{ (1, 1), (2, 2) , (3, 3), (2, 3), (3, 2) \\}
$$

$$
A / \mathfrak{B} = \\{ (1, 1), (2, 2) , (3, 3), (2, 3), (3, 2) \\} \text{ see Partitions yield an Equivalence relation }
$$

$$
A / ( A / \mathfrak{B} ) = \\{ \\{1 \\}, \\{2, 3 \\} \\}
$$
