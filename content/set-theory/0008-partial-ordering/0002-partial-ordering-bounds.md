# Partial ordering bounds

Let $(A, \leq)$ be a **partially ordered** set and let $X$ be a **subset** of $A$. We say that an element $L$ of $A$ is a **lower bound** for $X$ if and only if $L \leq x$ for all $x \in X$. $X$ is said to be **bounded below in $A$** if $X$ has a **lower bound** in $A$. An element $U$ of $A$ is said to be an **upper bound** for $X$ if and only if $x \leq U$ for all $x \in X$. $X$ is **bounded above** in $A$ if and only if $X$ has an **upper bound** in $A$. Finally, $X$ is said to be **bounded** in $A$ if and only if $X$ is both **bounded above** and **bounded below** in $A$, and **unbounded** in $A$ if and only if it is not **bounded**.

A lower or upper bound for a subset $X$ of a partially ordered set $A$ may or may not be contained in $X$. For example, in $(\mathbb{R}, \leq), 2$ is a **lower bound** both for $[2, 3]$ and for $(2, 3]$. If a **lower bound** $L$ for $X$ is also an element of $X$, we say that $L$ is a **least element** of $X$. Analogously, an **upper bound** $U$ of a subset $X$ of a **poset** $(A, \leq)$ is said to be a **greatest element** of $X$ if $U \in X$. By definition, a greatest element is an upper bound and a least element is a lower bound. However, a subset of a **poset** that is bounded above may or may not have a greatest element. $[4, 7)$ and $\\{1 - \frac{1}{n} | n \in \mathbb{N} \\}$ do not have a greatest element, even though they are both bounded above in $\mathbb{R}$.

In the **poset** $(\mathbb{R}, \leq)$, where $\leq$ represents ordinary "less then or equal to" the subsets $\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$ are all **unbounded** subsets, altought $\mathbb{N}$ is **bounded below**. The subset $\\{ \dots , -6, -3, 0, 3 \\}$ is **bounded above** (by $3$ or $15$ or $\pi$ e.g.) in $\mathbb{R}$, but not **below**. The **interval** $(5, \infty)$ is **bounded below** and not **above**, but the interval $(-3, 8)$ is **bounded**.
