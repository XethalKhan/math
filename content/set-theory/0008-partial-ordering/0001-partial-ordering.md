# Partial ordering

Let $A$ be a set and $R$ a relation on $A$. We say that $R$ is a **partial ordering of $A$** if and only if $R$ is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. A nonempty set $A$, together with a partial ordering $R$ on $A$, is often referred to as a **partially ordered set** or **poset**.

Since $\leq$ is the prototype for a **partial ordering**, it is not uncommon to denote generic partial ordering by the symbol $\leq$ rather than by the letter. We will often follow that convention and will sometimes use symbols $\leq_1, \leq_2$ and so on to denote specific examples of partial ordering.

A **poset** consists of two things, a nonempty set $A$ and a **partial ordering** $\leq$ on $A$. Often we will identify a **poset** by notation such as $(A, \leq)$. Occasionally, when there is no danger of confusion about the partial ordering, we may refer simply to the **poset** $A$.

Clearly $\leq$ is an example of a **partial ordering** on $\mathbb{R}$. It is **reflexive** since every real number is less then or equal to itself. It is **antisymmetric** since the only way we can have both $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$ is if $x = y$. It is **transitive** since, for any real numbers $x, y \text{ and } z$, if $x \leq y$ and $y \leq z$, then $x \leq z$.
