# Totally ordered

The **partially ordered set** $(A, \leq)$ is said to be **totally ordered** (or **linearly ordered** or a **chain**) if and only if, for any elements $x, y \in A$ either $x \leq y$ or $y \leq x$.

Its either $x \leq y$ or $y \leq x$, it can not be both.

Two elements $x$ and $y$ of a **poset** $(A, \leq)$ are said to be **comparable** if and only if either $x \leq y$ or $y \leq x$.

If $x$ and $y$ are element of a **poset** $(A, \leq)$ we denote by $x \lor y$ the element $lub\\{x, y\\}$, if it exists, while $glb\\{x, y\\}$ when it exists, is denoted by $x \land y$. These are called, respectively, the **join** and the **meet** of $x$ and $y$. This situation is not very interesting if $A$ is **totally ordered** in that case $x \lor y$ is simply the "larger", whereas $x \land y$ is the "smaller" of $x$ and $y$. But, in general, $x \lor y$ and $x \land y$ may be elements of $A$ other than either $x$ and $y$.
