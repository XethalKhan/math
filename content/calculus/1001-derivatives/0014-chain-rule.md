# Chain rule

Suppose that we have two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and they are both differentiable.

If we define $F(x) = (f \circ g)(x)$ then the derivative of $F(x)$ is,

$$
F'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x)
$$

Alternatively, if we have $y = f(u)$ and $u = g(x)$ then the derivative of $y$ is,

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \frac{du}{dx}
$$
