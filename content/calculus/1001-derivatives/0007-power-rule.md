# Power rule

If $f(x) = x^n$ then $f'(x) = n x^{n - 1} \text{ OR } \frac{d}{dx} (x^n) = n x^{n - 1}$, $n$ is any number

## Note

All we are doing here is bringing the original exponent down in front and multiplying and then subtracting one from the original exponent.

Note as well that in order to use this formula $n$ must be a number, it can’t be a variable. Also note that the base, the $x$, must be a variable, it can’t be a number.
