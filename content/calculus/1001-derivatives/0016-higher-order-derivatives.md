# Higher order derivatives

$$
f(x) = 5 x^3 - 3 x^2 + 10 x - 5
$$

$$
f'(x) = 15 x^2 - 6 x + 10
$$

Now, this is a function and so it can be differentiated. Here is the notation that we’ll use for that, as well as the derivative.

$$
f''(x) = (f'(x))' = 30 x - 6
$$

This is called the **second derivative** and $f'(x)$ is now called the **first derivative**.

Again, this is a function, so we can differentiate it again. This will be called the **third derivative**.

$$
f'''(x) = (f''(x))' = 30
$$

Continuing, we can differentiate again. This is called, oddly enough, the **fourth derivative**. We’re also going to be changing notation at this point. We can keep adding on primes, but that will get cumbersome after a while.

$$
f^{(4)}(x) = (f'''(x))' = 0
$$

This process can continue but notice that we will get zero for all derivatives after this point.

Collectively the second, third, fourth, etc. derivatives are called **higher order derivatives**.

## Alternate notation

Recall that there was a fractional notation for the first derivative.

$$
f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx}
$$

We can extend this to higher order derivatives.

$$
f''(x) = \frac{d^2 f}{d x^2}
\\;\\;\\;
f'''(x) = \frac{d^3 f}{d x^3}
\\;\\;\\;
\text{etc.}
$$
