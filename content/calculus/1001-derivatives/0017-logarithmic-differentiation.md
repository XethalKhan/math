# Logarithmic differentiation

**Logarithmic differentiation** is the technique of obtaining the derivative of an arithmetic expression by obtaining its (natural) logarithm before differentiation.

We can also use logarithmic differentiation to differentiate functions in the form.

$$
y = (f(x))^{g(x)}
$$

## Example

$$
y = 2^x
$$

$$
ln(y) = ln(2^x)
$$

$$
= x ln(2)
$$

$$
\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dx} = ln(2)
$$

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = y ln(2)
$$

$$
= 2^x ln(2)
$$
