# Properties of differentiation formulas

$$
(f(x) \pm g(x))' = f'(x) \pm g'(x)
\\;\\;\\;
\text{ OR }
\\;\\;\\;
\frac{d}{dx}(f(x) \pm g(x)) = \frac{df}{dx} \pm \frac{dg}{dx}
$$

In other words, to differentiate a sum or difference all we need to do is differentiate the individual terms and then put them back together with the appropriate signs. Note as well that this property is not limited to two functions.

$$
(c f(x))' = c f'(x)
\\;\\;\\;
\text{ OR }
\\;\\;\\;
\frac{d}{dx}(c f(x)) = c \frac{df}{dx},
\\;\\;\\; 
c \text{ is any number }
$$

In other words, we can “factor” a multiplicative constant out of a derivative if we need to.
