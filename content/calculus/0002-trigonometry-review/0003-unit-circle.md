# Unit circle

Below is unit circle filled in with the “standard” angles. The way the unit circle works is to draw a line from the center of the circle outwards corresponding to a given angle. Then look at the coordinates of the point where the line and the circle intersect. The first coordinate, i.e. the $x$-coordinate, is the cosine of that angle and the second coordinate, i.e. the $y$-coordinate, is the sine of that angle. We’ve put some of the standard angles along with the coordinates of their intersections on the unit circle.
