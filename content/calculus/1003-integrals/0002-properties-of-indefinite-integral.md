# Properties of indefinite integral

## 1.

$$
\int k f(x) dx = k \int f(x) dx \text{ where } k \text{ is any number. }
$$

So, we can factor multiplicative constants out of indefinite integrals.

## 2.

$$
\int - f(x) dx = - \int f(x) dx 
$$

This is really the first property with $k = -1$.

## 3.

$$
\int f(x) \pm g(x) dx = \int f(x) dx \pm \int g(x) dx
$$

In other words, the integral of a sum or difference of functions is the sum or difference of the individual integrals. This rule can be extended to as many functions as we need.
