# Definite integral

Given a function $f(x)$ that is **continuous** on the interval $[a, b]$ we divide the interval into $n$ subintervals of equal width, $\Delta x$, and from each interval choose a point, $x^{\ast}_i$. Then the **definite integral of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is

$$
\int^{b}_{a} f(x) dx = \lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum^{n}_{i = 1} f(x^{\ast}_i) \Delta x
$$

There is also a little bit of terminology that we should get out of the way here. The number $a$ that is at the bottom of the integral sign is called the **lower limit** of the integral and the number $b$ at the top of the integral sign is called the **upper limit** of the integral. Also, despite the fact that $a$ and $b$ were given as an interval the lower limit does not necessarily need to be smaller than the upper limit. Collectively weâ€™ll often call $a$ and $b$ the **interval of integration**.
