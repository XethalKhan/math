# Exponential function

Let’s start with $b \gt 0, b \neq 1$. An exponential function is then a function in the form,

$$
f(x) = b^{x}
$$

Note that we avoid $b = 1$ because that would give the constant function, $f(x) = 1$. We avoid $b = 0$ since this would also give a constant function and we avoid negative values of $b$ for the following reason.

Let’s, for a second, suppose that we did allow $b$ to be negative and look at the following function.

$$
g(x) = (−4)^{x}
$$

Let’s do some evaluation.

$$
g(2) = (−4)^2 = 16
\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;
g(\frac{1}{2}) = (−4)^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{−4} = 2i
$$

So, for some values of $x$ we will get real numbers and for other values of $x$ we will get complex numbers. We want to avoid this so if we require $b \gt 0$ this will not be a problem.
