# Change of base for logarithms

The change of base formula is,

$$
log_{b}(x) = \frac{log_{a}(x)}{log_{a}(b)}
$$

This is the most general change of base formula and will convert from base $b$ to base $a$. However, the usual reason for using the change of base formula is to compute the value of a logarithm that is in a base that you canâ€™t easily deal with. Using the change of base formula means that you can write the logarithm in terms of a logarithm that you can deal with.
