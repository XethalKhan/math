# Logarithm function

Weâ€™ll start with $b \gt 0, b \neq 1$. Then we have

$$
y = log_{b}(x)
\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;
\text{ is equivalent to }
\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;
x = b^y
$$

The first is called logarithmic form and the second is called the exponential form. Remembering this equivalence is the key to evaluating logarithms. The number, $b$, is called the base.
