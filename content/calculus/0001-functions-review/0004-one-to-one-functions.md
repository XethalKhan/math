# One to one functions

A function is called **one-to-one** if no two values of $x$ produce the same $y$. Mathematically this is the same as saying,

$$
f(x_1) \neq f(x_2) \text{ whenever } x_1 \neq x_2
$$

So, a function is one-to-one if whenever we plug different values into the function we get different function values.

Sometimes it is easier to understand this definition if we see a function that isn’t one-to-one. Let’s take a look at a function that isn’t one-to-one. The function $f(x) = x^{2}$ is not one-to-one because both $f(−2) = 4$ and $f(2) = 4$. In other words, there are two different values of $x$ that produce the same value of $y$. Note that we can turn $f(x) = x^{2}$ into a one-to-one function if we restrict ourselves to $0 \leq x \lt \infty$. This can sometimes be done with functions.

Showing that a function is one-to-one is often tedious and/or difficult. For the most part we are going to assume that the functions that we’re going to be dealing with in this course are either one-to-one or we have restricted the domain of the function to get it to be a one-to-one function.
