# Domain and range of a function

In simplest terms the **domain** of a function is the set of all values that can be plugged into a function and have the function exist and have a real number for a value. So, for the domain we need to avoid division by zero, square roots of negative numbers, logarithms of zero and logarithms of negative numbers (if not familiar with logarithms weâ€™ll take a look at them a little later), etc. The **range** of a function is simply the set of all possible values that a function can take.
