# Inverse functions

Given two **one-to-one functions** $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ if

$$
(f \circ g)(x) = x
\\;\\;\\;
\text{ AND }
\\;\\;\\;
(g \circ f)(x) = x
$$

then we say that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are **inverses** of each other. More specifically we will say that $g(x)$ is the inverse of $f(x)$ and denote it by

$$
g(x) = f^{−1}(x)
$$

Likewise, we could also say that $f(x)$ is the inverse of $g(x)$ and denote it by

$$
f(x) = g^{−1}(x)
$$

Now, be careful with the notation for inverses. The "-1" is NOT an exponent despite the fact that it sure does look like one! When dealing with inverse functions we’ve got to remember that

$$
f^{−1}(x) \neq \frac{1}{f(x)}
$$

This is one of the more common mistakes that students make when first studying inverse functions.
