# Root of a function
 

A root of a function is nothing more than a number for which the function is zero. In other words, finding the roots of a function, $g(x)$, is equivalent to solving

$$
g(x) = 0
$$

## Example

Determine all the roots of $f(t) = 9 t^3 − 18 t^2 + 6 t$

So, we will need to solve,

$$
9 t^3 − 18 t^2 + 6 t = 0
$$

First, we should factor the equation as much as possible. Doing this gives,

$$
3 t (3 t^2 − 6 t + 2) = 0
$$

Next recall that if a product of two things are zero then one (or both) of them had to be zero. This means that,

$$
3 t = 0
\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;
\text{ OR }
\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;
3 t^2 − 6 t + 2 = 0
$$

From the first it’s clear that one of the roots must then be $t = 0$. To get the remaining roots we will need to use the quadratic formula on the second equation. Doing this gives,

$$
t = \frac{− (− 6) \pm \sqrt{(− 6)^{2} − 4 (3)(2)}}{2 (3)}
$$

$$
= \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{12}}{6}
$$

$$
= \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(4) (3)}}{6}
$$

$$
= \frac{6 \pm 2 \sqrt{3}}{6}
$$

$$
= \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{3}}{3}
$$

$$
= 1 \pm \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{3}
$$

$$
= 1 \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

To complete the problem, here is a complete list of all the roots of this function.

$$
t = 0, t = \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3}, t = \frac{3 − \sqrt{3}}{3}
$$
