# Function composition

The composition of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is

$$
(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))
$$

In other words, compositions are evaluated by plugging the second function listed into the first function listed. Note as well that order is important here. Interchanging the order will more often than not result in a different answer.
