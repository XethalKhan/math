# Interior extremum theorem

If $f(x)$ has a relative extrema at $x = c$ and $f'(c)$ exists then $x = c$ is a **critical point** of $f(x)$. In fact, it will be a critical point such that $f'(c) = 0$.

This theorem tells us that there is a nice relationship between relative extrema and critical points. In fact, it will allow us to get a list of all possible relative extrema. Since a relative extrema must be a critical point the list of all critical points will give us a list of all possible relative extrema.

Be careful not to misuse this theorem. It doesn’t say that a critical point will be a relative extrema. To see this, consider the following case.

$$
f(x) = x^3
\\;\\;\\;
f'(x) = 3x^2
$$

Clearly $x = 0$ is a critical point. However, we saw in an earlier example this function has no relative extrema of any kind. So, critical points do not have to be relative extrema.

Also note that this theorem says nothing about absolute extrema. An absolute extrema may or may not be a critical point.

Fermat’s Theorem only works for critical points in which $f'(c) = 0$. This does not, however, mean that relative extrema won’t occur at critical points where the derivative does not exist.
