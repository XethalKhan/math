# Extreme value theorem

Suppose that $f(x)$ is **continuous** on the interval $[a, b]$ then there are two numbers $a \leq c, d \leq b$ so that $f(c)$ is an absolute maximum for the function and $f(d)$ is an absolute minimum for the function.

So, if we have a continuous function on an interval $[a, b]$ then we are guaranteed to have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum for the function somewhere in the interval. The theorem doesn’t tell us where they will occur or if they will occur more than once, but at least it tells us that they do exist somewhere. Sometimes, all that we need to know is that they do exist.

We should also point out that just because a function is not continuous at a point that doesn’t mean that it won’t have both absolute extrema in an interval that contains that point.

In order to use the Extreme Value Theorem we must have an interval that includes its endpoints, often called a closed interval, and the function must be continuous on that interval. If we don’t have a closed interval and/or the function isn’t continuous on the interval then the function may or may not have absolute extrema.
