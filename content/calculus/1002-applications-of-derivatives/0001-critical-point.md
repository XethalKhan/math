# Critical point

We say that $x = c$ is a **critical point** of the function $f(x)$ if $f(c)$ exists and if either of the following are true.

$$
f'(c) = 0
\\;\\;\\;
\text{ OR }
\\;\\;\\;
f'(c) \text{ doesn't exist }
$$

## Note

Note that we require that $f(c)$ exists in order for $x = c$ to actually be a critical point. This is an important, and often overlooked, point. What this is really saying is that all critical points must be in the **domain of the function**. If a point is not in the domain of the function then it is not a critical point.

It is important to note that not all functions will have critical points!
