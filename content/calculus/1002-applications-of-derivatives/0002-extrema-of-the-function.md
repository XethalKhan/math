# Extrema of the function

We say that $f(x)$ has an **absolute (or global) maximum** at $x = c$ if $f(x) \leq f(c)$ for every $x$ in the domain we are working on.

We say that $f(x)$ has a **relative (or local) maximum** at $x = c$ if $f(x) \leq f(c)$ for every $x$ in some open interval around $x = c$.

We say that $f(x)$ has an **absolute (or global) minimum** at $x = c$ if $f(x) \geq f(c)$ for every $x$ in the domain we are working on.

We say that $f(x)$ has a **relative (or local) minimum** at $x = c$ if $f(x) \geq f(c)$ for every $x$ in some open interval around $x = c$

Note that when we say an “open interval around $x = c$” we mean that we can find some interval $(a, b)$, not including the endpoints, such that $a \lt c \lt b$. Or, in other words, $c$ will be contained somewhere inside the interval and will not be either of the endpoints.

Also, we will collectively call the minimum and maximum points of a function the **extrema** of the function. So, relative extrema will refer to the relative minimums and maximums while absolute extrema refer to the absolute minimums and maximums.

We will have an absolute maximum (or minimum) at $x = c$ provided $f(c)$ is the largest (or smallest) value that the function will ever take on the domain that we are working on. Also, when we say the “domain we are working on” this simply means the range of $x$’s that we have chosen to work with for a given problem. There may be other values of $x$ that we can actually plug into the function but have excluded them for some reason.

A relative maximum or minimum is slightly different. All that’s required for a point to be a relative maximum or minimum is for that point to be a maximum or minimum in some interval of $x$’s around $x = c$. There may be larger or smaller values of the function at some other place, but relative to $x = c$, or local to $x = c, f(c)$ is larger or smaller than all the other function values that are near it.

## Note

Note as well that in order for a point to be a relative extrema we must be able to look at function values on both sides of $x = c$ to see if it really is a maximum or minimum at that point. This means that relative extrema do not occur at the end points of a domain. They can only occur interior to the domain.

There is actually some debate on the preceding point. Some folks do feel that relative extrema can occur on the end points of a domain. However, in this class we will be using the definition that says that they can’t occur at the end points of a domain. This will be discussed in a little more detail at the end of the section once we have a relevant fact taken care of.
