# Intermediate Value Theorem

Suppose that $f(x)$ is **continuous** on $[a, b]$ and let $M$ be any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then there exists a number $c$ such that,

1. $a \lt c \lt b$
2. $f(c) = M$

All the Intermediate Value Theorem is really saying is that a continuous function will take on all values between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.

The Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that a function will take the value of $M$ somewhere between $a$ and $b$ but it doesnâ€™t tell us where it will take the value nor does it tell us how many times it will take the value (once or more).
