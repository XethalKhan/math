# Squeeze theorem

Suppose that for all $x$ on $[a, b]$ (except possibly at $x = c$) we have,

$$
f(x) \leq h(x) \leq g(x)
$$

Also suppose that,

$$
\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = \lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} g(x) = L
$$

for some $a \leq c \leq b$.

Then,

$$
\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow c} h(x) = L
$$

We only need to know that $f(x) \leq h(x) \leq g(x)$ is true around $x = c$ because we are working with limits and they are only concerned with what is going on around $x = c$ and not what is actually happening at $x = c$.

The **Squeeze theorem** is also known as the **Sandwich Theorem** and the **Pinching Theorem**.
