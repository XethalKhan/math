# Limit

## Informal definition

We say that the limit of $f(x)$ is $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$ and write this as

$$
\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = L
$$

provided we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we want for all $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, from both sides, without actually letting $x$ be $a$.
