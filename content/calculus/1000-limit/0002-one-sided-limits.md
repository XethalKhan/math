# One sided limits

## Right-handed limit

We say

$$
\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow a^+} f(x) = L
$$

provided we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we want for all $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ with $x \gt a$ without actually letting $x$ be $a$.

## Left-handed limit

We say

$$
\lim\limits_{x \rightarrow a^-} f(x) = L
$$

provided we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we want for all $x$ sufficiently close to $a$ with $x \lt a$ without actually letting $x$ be $a$.
