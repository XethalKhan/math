# The cosine of $\alpha$

In a right triangle with **acute angle** $\alpha$, the ratio of the leg adjacent to the angle $\alpha$ to the hypotenuse is called the **cosine of $\alpha$**, abbreviated $cos(\alpha)$.

$$
cos(\alpha) = \frac{b}{h} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

As the angle $\alpha$ gets closer and closer to $90$, the hypotenuse remains the same length, but the adjacent leg gets shorter and shorter. So $cos(90) = 0$.
