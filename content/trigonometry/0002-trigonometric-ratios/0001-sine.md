# The sine of $\alpha$

For any **acute angle** $\alpha$, we draw a right triangle that includes $\alpha$. The sine of $\alpha$, abbreviated $sin(\alpha)$, is the ratio of the length of the leg opposite this angle to the length of the hypothenuse of the triangle.

$$
sin(\alpha) = \frac{a}{h} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

As the angle $\alpha$ gets larger, the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse approaches $1$. So: $sin(90) = 1$. The hypotenuse of a right triangle is longer than either leg. Since $sin(\alpha)$ is the ratio of a leg of a right triangle to its hypotenuse, $sin(\alpha)$ can never be larger than $1$.
