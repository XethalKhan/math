# Trigonometric ratios depend on the size of an acute angle

The values of the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle depend only on the size of the angle itself, and not on the particular right triangle containing the angle.

## Proof

Any two triangles containing a given acute angle are similar, so ratios of corresponding sides are equal. The trigonometric ratios are just names for these ratios.
