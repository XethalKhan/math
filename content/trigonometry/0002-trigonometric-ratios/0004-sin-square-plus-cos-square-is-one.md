# $sin^2(\alpha) + cos^2(\alpha) = 1$

As usual we draw a right angle that includes the angle $\alpha$

Suppose the legs have length $a$ and $b$, and the hypotenuse has length $h$. Then

$$
sin^2(\alpha) + cos^2(\alpha) = (\frac{a}{h})^2 + (\frac{b}{h})^2 = \frac{(a + b)^2}{c^2}
$$

But the Pythagorean theorem tells us that $a^2 + b^2 = h^2$, so the last fraction is equal to one, that is $sin^2(\alpha) + cos^2(\alpha) = 1$
