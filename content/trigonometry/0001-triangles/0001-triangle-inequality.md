# Triangle inequality

For any **triangle**, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side.

## Proof

Euclid proved the triangle inequality for distances in plane geometry using the construction in the image. Beginning with triangle $ABC$, an **isosceles triangle** is constructed with one side taken as $BC$ and the other equal leg $BD$, along the extension of side $AC$. It is then argued that angle $\beta$ is larger than angle $\alpha$, so side $AD$ is longer than side $AC$. But $AD = AB + BD = AB + BC$, so the sum of the lengths of sides $AB$ and $BC$ is larger than the length of $AC$.
