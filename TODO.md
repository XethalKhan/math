1. COnsider adding metadata into .MD files with "gray-matter" package (https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/basics/data-fetching/blog-data)

2. FOr content/linear-algebra/0011-orthogonality/0014-orthogonal-sets-are-linearly-independent.md we need to be aware of **Relation of Linear Independence** before this theorem. Put definition of linear independence before this theorem, somewhere. Probably best with content/linear-algebra/0002-types-of-solution-sets to use for **particular + homogenous solution**

3. Finish proof of content/linear-algebra/0001-systems-of-linear-equations/0023-rrfu-is-unique.md

4. Related to TODO #2, move linear-algebra/0011-orthogonality after abstract vector space materials. Definitions 14 and 15 require knowledge of linear dependence and spans, so orthogonality is probably best to read after vector space, spans, basis and relations of linear dependence. Review Gram-Schmidt procedure after that
